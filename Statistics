I tested the runtime in both Python and C++ implementation of stack with a similar set of data. 

DATA_IN: `6 1 11 6 1 13 6 1 15 6 2 6 3 6 4 6 5 6 7`

The results can be seen in `/C++/data.out` and `/Python/data_out`

Implementation time: for c++ took me about 1 and a half hour while for Python it took me only around 45 minutes.
